To display a Nomic Atlas dataset on a website, I set my Nomic Atlas dataset to public and made an <iframe> using the public sharing URL.

Hereâ€™s the Nomic Atlas data visualization hosted on a [GitHub Pages website](https://connerdrake98.github.io/iris-atlas-embed/). It works whether you are signed into Nomic Atlas or not, so anyone can use it regardless of whether they have a Nomic Atlas account.

There are probably other ways to embed a Nomic Atlas dataset on a website, although their documentation does not mention any. I think there might be other ways of doing this alluded to in their [External Integrations Documentation](https://docs.nomic.ai/atlas/integrations/external-integrations).
